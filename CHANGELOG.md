# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Pre-Release] - 2025-08-04
### Added 
- Exclusive write access to fwclouds. Only one user can edit a fwcloud at a time; additional users accessing the same fwcloud will be placed in read-only mode.
- Integration with AI API to query firewall policies. Users can now ask questions about the rules within a policy and receive AI-generated responses.
- Configuration section for AI integration. Administrators can set up and manage the communication parameters with the AI API directly from FWCloud.
- New plugins are available to install and configure WireGuard and IPsec (based on strongSwan) directly from FWCloud.
- Multi-VPN support. In addition to OpenVPN, FWCloud can now manage WireGuard and IPsec (strongSwan) VPNs in the same way as OpenVPN.
- Systemctl management for WireGuard and IPsec (strongSwan) services, allowing direct control (start, stop, restart, status, etc.) from FWCloud.
- Database schema migrations to support new features. Includes updates to tables and indexes required for recent functionality.
- Test coverage for new features, including unit and integration tests to ensure stability and prevent regressions.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-03-18
### Added
- Optimizations in API calls for policy and trees (firewalls, objects, services and CA) get. Around 10 times faster.

- Log detailed information for websocket connection/disconnection.
- Disable etag in express for avoid the problem explained in the http-application.ts file.
- Bug in autodiscover when the `ip a` command returns interfaces with name like this one: `ens193.40@ens193:` In such cases the interface name must be the string preceding the `@` character.

### Changed
- Removed table policy_c and all the code that uses it.
- Removed `mysqldump` and `mysql-import` node modules.
- Set the maximum size of accepted data for BodyParser to 2MB.
